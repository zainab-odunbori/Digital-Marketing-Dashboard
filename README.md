### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation, we performed the following task.
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the campaign data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the Overall Sales trend for each campaign channel
- Which Products are top sellers?
- What Campaign Channel gave the most Sales
- What Campaign Channel gabe the most Return On Investment
- What is the Return on Investment for each Product by Channel
- Which product had the highest Return on Investement

### Data Analysis

I used Power BI to design and build an interactive dashboard. Power BI was chosen for its ability to handle large datasets, create dynamic visualizations, and provide interactive features such as slicers for detailed analysis.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks the following major KPIs:
- Ad Spend
- Impressions
- Clicks
-	Conversions
-	Revenue
-	Return on Investment (ROI)

Each KPI is displayed as a card showing total performance.
Slicers were also implemented on the left side of the dashboard for:
-	Product
-	Campaign Date
-	Category
-	Marketing Channel
These slicers allow the Digital Marketing team to filter and interact with the dashboard for more targeted insights.
Insights from Visuals.

The dashboard revealed the performance of the companyâ€™s advertising channels, namely:
-	Google Ads
-	Referral
-	Email Campaign
-	Instagram Ads
-	Influencer Marketing


### Key Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. Ad Spend Distribution: Google Ads had the highest spend, while Influencer Marketing had the lowest. This was visually highlighted with green for the highest and red for the lowest
2. ROI & Conversions: Spending more did not directly result in better returns.
3. Google Ads had the highest spend but did not deliver the highest sales.
4. The highest sales (especially Cold Drinks) came from Referral.
5.	The highest ROI (notably in Household products) was achieved through Instagram Ads, which also had the highest conversion rate.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following for future campaigns:
1.	Increase investment in Instagram Ads, as they delivered stronger ROI and conversion rates compared to other channels.
2.	Review Google Ads strategy, since high spending did not translate to high return, Optimization may be needed.
3.	Leverage Referral campaigns further, as they showed the highest sales performance in certain product categories.
